Algorithm


INIT : 

1. create consets.py for conset variables.
2. set 3.14 in P variable.


Diamond:

1. get small diagonal of user and set it in small_d variable.
2. get big diagonal of user and set it in big_d variable.
3. small_d division 2 and exponent 2, big_d division 2 and exponent 2 then sum thsse and set it in side variable.
3. multip small_d to big_d to P then division to 2 and set it in area variable.
4. multip side to 4 and set it in env variable.
5. show env and area variables to user.


Rectangle:

1. get width of user and set it in with variable.
2. get height of user and set it in heigth variable.
3. multip width to height and set it in area variable.
4. sum width to height and multip it result to 2. set result in env variable.
5. show env and area variables to user.


Parallelogram:

1. get width and set it in width variable.
2. get height and set it in height variable.
3. get h and set it in h variable.
4. multip width to h and set it in area variable.
5. sum widht to height, then multip to 2 and set it in env variable.
6. show area and env variables to user.

Circle:

1. get radius of user and set it in R variable.
3. multip R to R to P ( R*R*P ) and set it in area variable.
4. multip 2R to P ( R*2*P ) and set it in env variable.
5. show env and area variables to user.
